# 100daysofcode
Journey to learn Python over 100 days of projects. Give or take.
Hi, my name is Charles and this repository is a culmination of both
learning how to code in Python and learning how to use Git.
I intend to document my journey from a beginner in Python to ideally
a high intermediate level by the time I reach day 100. Along the way I would 
like to become more efficient in the usage of Git and GitHub and
I intend for my profile to reflect that overall improvement along the way.

Thank you for reading!
